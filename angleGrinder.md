Angle grinders are used for metalwork and fabrication such as grinding down welds. They are also used in construction. They are commonly used in workshops, service garages, and auto body repair shops. Angle grinders can be dangerous due to the high rpm involved and the sparks and bits of metal that fly off as they cut.

## Safety Recommendation:
1. Wear safety glasses, jeans pent, mask, and hand gloves. Proper leather boots and earplugs are recommended.</br>
2. Always physically unplug the power plug when you do not use it or change the disk. Switching off is not enough.
3. Insert the disk into the machine on the correct side. Some experts suggest that the cutting disk should be mounted backward (written side backward https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEz0aFJm0lY) while some experts suggest the opposite (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4jayQQbYQ8). 
4. Before use, ensure the auxiliary handle is attached.
5. Ensure operators grip both handles during use.
6. Always use the correct type of disc. Ensure the disc speed limit (rpm) exceeds the angle grinder operating speed.
7. Check the expiry date of the disc. Keep the disc in the properly enclosed box to protect it from humidity. 
8. Ensure the guard and handles are secure.
9. Ensure the correct flange and the locking nut is used for the disc type. Otherwise, the disc can shatter at high speed.
10. Ensure the disc is not defective or damaged.
11. Allow the grinder to “run-up” to operating speed before applying it to the job.
12. Hold the grinder against the workpiece with minimum pressure so the disc doesn’t “dig in” and cause it to kick back.
13. Never bump the grinder onto the work, or let the disc hit any other object while grinding.
14. Keep the grinding disc at a 15 to 30-degree angle to the work. Not applicable for cutting disk. Check disk (usually you will find the operation angle on the disk as image)
15. Ensure the workpiece is held firmly in a bench vice when appropriate.
16. Keep the work at waist height during grinding.
17. Stop the grinder regularly to rest your hands and arms.
18. When not in use, disconnect the power and place the grinder on a bench with the disc facing upwards.
19. Never put a grinder down until the disc stops rotating.
20. Disconnect power before changing discs.
21. Never use a cut-off wheel for grinding or a grinding disc for cutting.
22. Dispose of any disc that has been dropped. Cracked or weakened discs can shatter in use.
