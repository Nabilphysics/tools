## Safety Recommendation:
1. Wear safety glasses, jeans pent, mask, and hand gloves. Proper leather boots and earplugs are recommended.
2. Make sure worktable and if any vice attached to it is secured. Worktable is usually moveable, and if you move it to the upper portion of the drill press column, make sure you hold it during lowering to avoid a sudden fall down.
3. Run drill at correct RPM for diameter of drill bit and material. Ask shop personnel for the correct RPM.
4. Always hold work in a vise or clamp to the drill table. Materil has tendency to spin with drill bit.
5. Use a correctly ground drill bit for the material being drilled. 
6. If applicable Use the proper cutting fluid for the material being drilled. Ask the shop staff about the appropriate fluid for the material you are machining.
7. Remove chips with a brush, never by hand.
8. Ease up on drilling pressure as the drill starts to break through the bottom of the material.
9. Don't use a dull or cracked drill. Inspect the drill before using.
10. Don't drill with too much pressure.
11. Always try to support part on parallels or a backing board when drilling thru material.
12. Never place taper shank tools such as large diameter drills or tapered shank reamers in a drill chuck. Only straight shank tools such as standard drills can be clamped in chucks.
13. Always clean drill shank and/or drill sleeve, and, spindle hole before mounting.
14. Remove taper shank tools from spindle or sleeve with a drill drift and hammer.
15. Never try to loosen the drill chuck while the power is on.
16. Lower the drill spindle close to the table when releasing the drill chuck or taper shank drill to reduce the chance of damage should they fall onto the table.
17. Never clean a machine while it is in motion!!
18. If the drill binds in a hole, stop the machine and turn the spindle backwards by hand to release the bit.
19. When drilling a deep hole withdraw the drill bit frequently to clear chips and lubricate the bit.
20. Always remove the drill chuck key, or, the drill drift from the spindle immediately after using it.
21. Let the spindle stop of its own accord after turning the power off. Never try to stop the spindle with your hand.
22. Plexiglas and other brittle plastics can be difficult to drill. Ask a shop technician for advice on drill and coolant selection when drilling these materials.
