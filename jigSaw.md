# Safety Recommendations:</br>
1. Wear safety glasses, jeans pent, mask, and hand gloves. Proper leather boots and earplugs are recommended.  </br>
2. Do not wear jewelry or loose clothing and tie long hair back to avoid possible entanglement.</br>
3. Secure your working perimeter and do not entertain unauthorized personnel to watch.</br>
4. Always physically unplug the power plug when you do not use it. Switching off is not enough.</br>
5. Always physically unplug when you change the blade.</br>
6. Do not force the device with your left-hand finger(If you hold the device with your right hand). Your finger may slip toward the blade.</br> 
7. Always keep your fingers away from saw blades when cutting. Never put your hands underneath of the work surface. Never try to clean off the jigsaw table with your hands while the saw is running.</br>
8. Make sure the blade is connected to the T-shank properly.</br>
9. Make sure that the blade is sharp and there are no broken teeth, bent or broken sections, or any other damage</br>
10. Do not allow anybody to stay in your projected cutting direction.</br>
11. During cutting make sure electrical wire or any other things that are not intended to cut is not present, especially underneath. </br>
12. Make sure of the blade property. Ex. Wood blade, Metal blade, TPI, etc</br>
13. Properly secure the intended cutting object with a clamp or any other tools so that it will not move around when you begin to operate the jigsaw.</br>
14. When you are about to finish the cutting make sure you hold the jigsaw properly so it does not fall. We have a tendency to rely on cutting objects to hold their weight. But when the cutting of the object is finished and the two parts are separated, the jigsaw might fall if you don't hold it. </br>
15. Ensure that guards, battery packs (if cordless), and cords (if applicable) are free of damage and in place.</br>
16. Before cutting the wood or metal give it some time to stabilize its speed. </br>
17. Good balance and proper footing while operating the equipment is important.</br>
18. Hold the jigsaw with two hands when operating it (see picture beside). Beyond helping to control Jigsaw Safety Showing Two Hands the equipment, this will keep your fingers away from the moving portion of the blade that extends below the material being cut.</br>

20. Do not apply excessive force when using a jigsaw, especially when cutting curves and angles. Ensure that the blade does not twist or bind (if necessary, drill small holes).</br>
21. Periodically examine the material for splits, loose knots and nails. Ensure the material is secure and well supported.</br>
If the blade binds, release the switch immediately â€“ free the blade and inspect for damage.</br>
Do not remove the saw from the workpiece until the blade has come to a complete stop.</br>
